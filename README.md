# macinstyle
Macinstyle is a front-end framework to look like macOS Big Sur. A new version is released with a new version of macOS.<br>
Macinstyle is still in heavy development and only supports a few components. Use if you would like but I don't suggest using it yet!
# Documentation
Coming soon, not written.
All documentation is available in Markdown [here](https://github.com/mr-winson/macinstyle/tree/docs/docs). Or website [here](https://mr-winson.github.io/macinstyle).
# Usage
To use `macinstyle` you need to make sure your app has access to the CSS/JS files. There are currently two ways to do this.
### CDN (Soon)
The CDN will be coming soon and will default to macOS Big Sur (macOS 11)<br>
Import the files and scripts using a CDN:
#### CSS:
  `<link rel='stylesheet' href='Coming Soon'>`<br>
#### JS:
  `<script src='Coming Soon'></script>`
  
### Download Source
Head over to [/builds](/builds) and download the `macos-*.*.*.zip` (replace stars with the version you want to use) file and extract it. It has all the CSS/JS you need. Or you can go to [releases](/releases).
